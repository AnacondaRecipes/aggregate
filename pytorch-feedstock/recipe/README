This recipe uses environmental variables to set the CUDA and CuDNN versions
that the package is built against. To build this recipe call conda-build
with the appropiate variables set:

  CUDA_VERSION=8.0 CUDNN_VERSION=6.0 conda build --python 2.7 .

This will create a package named: pytorch-0.1.12-py27cuda7.5cudnn6.0_1.tar.bz2
