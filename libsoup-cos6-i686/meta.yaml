      summary: "(CDT) Soup, an HTTP library implementation"
      description: |
        Libsoup is an HTTP library implementation in C. It was originally part of a
        SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation called Soup, but the SOAP
        and non-SOAP parts have now been split into separate packages.  libsoup uses
        the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK applications. This
        enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers on the network in a
        completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to the Gtk+ programming model (a
        synchronous operation mode is also supported for those who want it).
