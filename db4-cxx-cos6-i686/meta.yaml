      description: |
        The Berkeley Database (Berkeley DB) is a programmatic toolkit that provides
        embedded database support for both traditional and client/server applications.
        The Berkeley DB includes B+tree, Extended Linear Hashing, Fixed and Variable-
        length record access methods, transactions, locking, logging, shared memory
        caching, and database recovery. The Berkeley DB supports C, C++, Java, and
        Perl APIs. It is used by many applications, including Python and Perl, so this
        should be installed on all systems.
