  summary: Free and Open Source API and drivers for immersive technology
  description: |
    OpenHMD aims to provide a Free and Open Source API and drivers for
    immersive technology, such as head mounted displays with built in
    head tracking. Our aim is to implement support for as many devices
    as possible in a portable, cross-platform package.
    OpenHMD supports a wide range of devices such as Oculus Rift,
    HTC Vive, Sony PSVR, Deepoon E2 and others. We also support a
    Generic Android driver and a External Sesnsor data driver to
    allow the use of our Sensor Fusion and features, while providing
    your own data.
