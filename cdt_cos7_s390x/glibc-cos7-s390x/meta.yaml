  summary: "(CDT) The GNU libc libraries"
  description: |
        The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by multiple
        programs on the system. In order to save disk space and memory, as well as to
        make upgrading easier, common system code is kept in one place and shared
        between programs. This particular package contains the most important sets of
        shared libraries: the standard C library and the standard math library.
        Without these two libraries, a Linux system will not function.
