  summary: A loader interface around multiple config file formats.
  description: |
    plaster is a loader interface around arbitrary config file formats. It exists
    to define a common API for applications to use when they wish to load
    configuration settings. The library itself does not aim to handle anything
    except a basic API that applications may use to find and load configuration
    settings. Any specific constraints should be implemented in a pluggable
    loader which can be registered via an entrypoint.
