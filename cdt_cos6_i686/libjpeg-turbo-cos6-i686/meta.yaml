  summary: "(CDT) A MMX/SSE2 accelerated library for manipulating JPEG image files"
  description: |
        The libjpeg-turbo package contains a library of functions for manipulating
        JPEG images. It also contains simple client programs for accessing the libjpeg
        functions. It contains cjpeg, djpeg, jpegtran, rdjpgcom and wrjpgcom. Cjpeg
        compresses an image file into JPEG format. Djpeg decompresses a JPEG file into
        a regular image file. Jpegtran can perform various useful transformations on
        JPEG files. Rdjpgcom displays any text comments included in a JPEG file.
        Wrjpgcom inserts text comments into a JPEG file.
