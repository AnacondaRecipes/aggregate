      summary: "(CDT) Interfaces for accessibility support"
      description: |
        The ATK library provides a set of interfaces for adding accessibility support
        to applications and graphical user interface toolkits. By supporting the ATK
        interfaces, an application or toolkit can be used with tools such as screen
        readers, magnifiers, and alternative input devices.
