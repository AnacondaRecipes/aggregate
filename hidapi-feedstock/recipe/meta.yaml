  summary: Simple lib for communicating with USB and Bluetooth HID devices
  description: |
    HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to interface
    with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac
    OS X.  HIDAPI can be either built as a shared library (.so or .dll) or
    can be embedded directly into a target application by adding a single source
    file (per platform) and a single header.
