      summary: "(CDT) An XML parser library"
      description: |
        This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat is
        a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with the
        parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the parser
        discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A start tag
        is an example of the kind of structures for which you may register handlers.
