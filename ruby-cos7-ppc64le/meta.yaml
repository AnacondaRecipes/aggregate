      summary: "(CDT) An interpreter of object-oriented scripting language"
      description: |
        Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented
        programming.  It has many features to process text files and to do system
        management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and
        extensible.
