      summary: "(CDT) A 2D graphics library"
      description: |
        Cairo is a 2D graphics library designed to provide high-quality display and
        print output. Currently supported output targets include the X Window System,
        OpenGL (via glitz), in-memory image buffers, and image files (PDF, PostScript,
        and SVG).  Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media
        while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (e.g.
        through the X Render Extension or OpenGL).
