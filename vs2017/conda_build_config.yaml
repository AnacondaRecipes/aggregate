# this version follows the version number reported for the vcruntim140.dll file.
#     This will be in a folder like C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\VC\Redist\MSVC\14.15.26706\x64\Microsoft.VC141.CRT
#     Note the 14.15.26706 in there - that's what we want, but in case their folder scheme changes, it's better to base it on the version of the file itself.
