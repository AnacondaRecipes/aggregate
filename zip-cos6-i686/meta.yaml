      summary: "(CDT) A file compression and packaging utility compatible with PKZIP"
      description: |
        The zip program is a compression and file packaging utility.  Zip is analogous
        to a combination of the UNIX tar and compress commands and is compatible with
        PKZIP (a compression and file packaging utility for MS-DOS systems).  Install
        the zip package if you need to compress files using the zip program.
