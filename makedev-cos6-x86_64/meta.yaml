  summary: "(CDT) A program used for creating device files in /dev"
  description: |
        This package contains the MAKEDEV program, which makes it easier to create and
        maintain the files in the /dev directory.  /dev directory files correspond to
        a particular device supported by Linux (serial or printer ports, scanners,
        sound cards, tape drives, CD-ROM drives, hard drives, etc.) and interface with
        the drivers in the kernel.  You should install the MAKEDEV package because the
        MAKEDEV utility makes it easy to manage the /dev directory device files.
