  summary: "(CDT) Files needed for developing PAM-aware applications and modules for PAM"
  description: |
        PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a system security tool that allows
        system administrators to set authentication policy without having to recompile
        programs that handle authentication. This package contains header files and
        static libraries used for building both PAM-aware applications and modules for
        use with PAM.
