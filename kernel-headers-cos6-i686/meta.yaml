  summary: "(CDT) Header files for the Linux kernel for use by glibc"
  description: |
        Kernel-headers includes the C header files that specify the interface between
        the Linux kernel and userspace libraries and programs.  The header files
        define structures and constants that are needed for building most standard
        programs and are also needed for rebuilding the glibc package.
