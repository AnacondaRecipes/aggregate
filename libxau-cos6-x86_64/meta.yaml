  summary: "(CDT) Sample Authorization Protocol for X"
  description: |
        This is a very simple mechanism for providing individual access to an X Window
        System display.It uses existing core protocol and library hooks for specifying
        authorization data in the connection setup block to restrict use of the
        display to only those clients that show that they know a server-specific key
        called a "magic cookie".
