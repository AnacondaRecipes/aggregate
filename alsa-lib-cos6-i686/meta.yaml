      description: |
        The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) provides audio and MIDI
        functionality to the Linux operating system.  This package includes the ALSA
        runtime libraries to simplify application programming and provide higher level
        functionality as well as support for the older OSS API, providing binary
        compatibility for most OSS programs.
