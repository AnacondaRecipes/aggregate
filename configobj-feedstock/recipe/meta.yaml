  summary: Config file reading, writing and validation.
  description: "**ConfigObj** is a simple but powerful config file reader and writer: an *ini\nfile round tripper*. Its main feature is that it is very easy to use, with a\nstraightforward programmer's\
    \ interface and a simple syntax for config files.\nIt has lots of other features though :\n\n* Nested sections (subsections), to any level\n* List values\n* Multiple line values\n* Full Unicode support\n\
    * String interpolation (substitution)\n* Integrated with a powerful validation system\n\n    - including automatic type checking/conversion\n    - and allowing default values\n    - repeated sections\n\
    \n* All comments in the file are preserved\n* The order of keys/sections is preserved\n* Powerful ``unrepr`` mode for storing/retrieving Python data-types\n\n| Release 5.0.6 improves error messages\
    \ in certain edge cases\n| Release 5.0.5 corrects a unicode-bug that still existed in writing files\n| Release 5.0.4 corrects a unicode-bug that still existed in reading files after\n| fixing lists\
    \ of string in 5.0.3\n| Release 5.0.3 corrects errors related to the incorrectly handling unicode\n| encoding and writing out files\n| Release 5.0.2 adds a specific error message when trying to install\
    \ on\n| Python versions older than 2.5\n| Release 5.0.1 fixes a regression with unicode conversion not happening\n| in certain cases PY2\n| Release 5.0.0 updates the supported Python versions to 2.6,\
    \ 2.7, 3.2, 3.3\n| and is otherwise unchanged\n| Release 4.7.2 fixes several bugs in 4.7.1\n| Release 4.7.1 fixes a bug with the deprecated options keyword in\n| 4.7.0.\n| Release 4.7.0 improves performance\
    \ adds features for validation and\n| fixes some bugs."
