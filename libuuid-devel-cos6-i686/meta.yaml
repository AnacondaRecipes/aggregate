      summary: "(CDT) Universally unique ID library"
      description: |
        This is the universally unique ID development library and headers, part of
        util-linux-ng.  The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally
        unique id's (UUID's).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
        space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can be used
        for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime,
        to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.  See also
        the "uuid-devel" package, which is a separate implementation.
