  summary: "(CDT) Common Unix Printing System - libraries"
  description: |
        The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for UNIXÂ®
        operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software Products to promote
        a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors and users. CUPS provides the
        System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces. The cups-libs package provides
        libraries used by applications to use CUPS natively, without needing the
        lp/lpr commands.
