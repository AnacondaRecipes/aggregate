  summary: "(CDT) Library providing XML and HTML support"
  description: |
        This library allows to manipulate XML files. It includes support to read,
        modify and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs support this includes
        parsing and validation even with complex DtDs, either at parse time or later
        once the document has been modified. The output can be a simple SAX stream or
        and in-memory DOM like representations. In this case one can use the built-in
        XPath and XPointer implementation to select subnodes or ranges. A flexible
        Input/Output mechanism is available, with existing HTTP and FTP modules and
        combined to an URI library.
