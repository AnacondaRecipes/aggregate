  # Since libxar is linked to ld64 it's imperative that we

  # at the point of consumption. If this library generated
  # .pc files and if my port of ld64 read those this would
  # not be necessary; still it should be safe. One thing to
  # take care about is that libcrypto.dylib is needed and
  # we want that to come from a 10.9 sysroot and not from
  # a conda openssl package. The way to ensure this happens
  # is by linking to '/usr/lib/libcrypto.dylib' directly,
  # instead of using '-L/usr/lib -lcrypto'
