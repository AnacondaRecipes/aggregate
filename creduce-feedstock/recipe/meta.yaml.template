  summary: 'C-Reduce, a C program reducer'
  description: |
    C-Reduce is a tool that takes a large C, C++, or OpenCL file that has
    a property of interest (such as triggering a compiler bug) and
    automatically produces a much smaller C/C++ file that has the same
    property. It is intended for use by people who discover and report
    bugs in compilers and other tools that process source code.
