  summary: "(CDT) Universally unique ID library"
  description: |
        This is the universally unique ID library, part of util-linux-ng.  The libuuid
        library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique id's (UUID's).  A UUID
        is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to
        the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from
        tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very
        persistent objects across a network.  See also the "uuid" package, which is a
        separate implementation.
