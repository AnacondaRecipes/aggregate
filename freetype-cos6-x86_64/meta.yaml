  summary: "(CDT) A free and portable font rendering engine"
  description: |
        The FreeType engine is a free and portable font rendering engine, developed to
        provide advanced font support for a variety of platforms and environments.
        FreeType is a library which can open and manages font files as well as
        efficiently load, hint and render individual glyphs. FreeType is not a font
        server or a complete text-rendering library.
