  summary: "(CDT) GNU libraries and utilities for producing multi-lingual messages"
  description: |
        The GNU gettext package provides a set of tools and documentation for
        producing multi-lingual messages in programs. Tools include a set of
        conventions about how programs should be written to support message catalogs,
        a directory and file naming organization for the message catalogs, a runtime
        library which supports the retrieval of translated messages, and stand-alone
        programs for handling the translatable and the already translated strings.
        Gettext provides an easy to use library and tools for creating, using, and
        modifying natural language catalogs and is a powerful and simple method for
        internationalizing programs.
