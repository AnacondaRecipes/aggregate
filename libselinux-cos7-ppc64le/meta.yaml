      description: |
        Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux® kernel and a number of
        utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory
        access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
        architectural components originally developed to improve the security of the
        Flask operating system. These architectural components provide general support
        for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control policies,
        including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
        Control, and Multi-level Security.  libselinux provides an API for SELinux
        applications to get and set process and file security contexts and to obtain
        security policy decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
        API.
