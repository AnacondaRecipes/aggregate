  summary: "(CDT) Libraries, includes, etc. to develop XML and HTML applications"
  description: |
        Libraries, include files, etc you can use to develop XML applications. This
        library allows to manipulate XML files. It includes support to read, modify
        and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs support this includes parsing and
        validation even with complex DtDs, either at parse time or later once the
        document has been modified. The output can be a simple SAX stream or and in-
        memory DOM like representations. In this case one can use the built-in XPath
        and XPointer implementation to select subnodes or ranges. A flexible
        Input/Output mechanism is available, with existing HTTP and FTP modules and
        combined to an URI library.
