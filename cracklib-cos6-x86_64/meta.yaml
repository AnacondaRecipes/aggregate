      summary: "(CDT) A password-checking library"
      description: |
        CrackLib tests passwords to determine whether they match certain security-
        oriented characteristics, with the purpose of stopping users from choosing
        passwords that are easy to guess. CrackLib performs several tests on
        passwords: it tries to generate words from a username and gecos entry and
        checks those words against the password; it checks for simplistic patterns in
        passwords; and it checks for the password in a dictionary.  CrackLib is
        actually a library containing a particular C function which is used to check
        the password, as well as other C functions. CrackLib is not a replacement for
        a passwd program; it must be used in conjunction with an existing passwd
        program.  Install the cracklib package if you need a program to check users'
        passwords to see if they are at least minimally secure. If you install
        CrackLib, you will also want to install the cracklib-dicts package.
