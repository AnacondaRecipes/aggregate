  summary: Optimized primitives for collective multi-GPU communication
  description: |
    NCCL (pronounced "Nickel") is a stand-alone library of standard
    collective communication routines, such as all-gather, reduce,
    broadcast, etc., that have been optimized to achieve high bandwidth
    over PCIe. NCCL supports an arbitrary number of GPUs installed in a
    single node and can be used in either single- or multi-process
    (e.g., MPI) applications.
